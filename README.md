# grabCameraFrameExample
Example of taking raw pixel data from gstreamer by v4l2 and rtsp camera.

This is part of my gstreamer learning\testing. I based it on gstreamer tutorials.
I didn't find example similar to this. That's why I decided to share this with you. Maybe I didn't search too hard :P. 
Anyway, I hope this will be helpfull for people who starts their adventure with cameras / gstreamer etc. on linux.
